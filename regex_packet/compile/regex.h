 * Regular Expressions:
 *
 *      [1]     char    matches itself, unless it is a special
 *                      character (metachar): . \ [ ] * + ^ $
 *
 *      [2]     .       matches any character.
 *
 *      [3]     \       matches the character following it, except
 *			when followed by a left or right round bracket,
 *			a digit 1 to 9 or a left or right angle bracket. 
 *			(see [7], [8] and [9])
 *			It is used as an escape character for all 
 *			other meta-characters, and itself. When used
 *			in a set ([4]), it is treated as an ordinary
 *			character.
 *
 *      [4]     [set]   matches one of the characters in the set.
 *                      If the first character in the set is "^",
 *                      it matches a character NOT in the set, i.e. 
 *			complements the set. A shorthand S-E is 
 *			used to specify a set of characters S upto 
 *			E, inclusive. The special characters "]" and 
 *			"-" have no special meaning if they appear 
 *			as the first chars in the set.
 *                      examples:        match:
 *
 *                              [a-z]    any lowercase alpha
 *
 *                              [^]-]    any char except ] and -
 *
 *                              [^A-Z]   any char except uppercase
 *                                       alpha
 *
 *                              [a-zA-Z] any alpha
 *
 *      [5]     *       any regular expression form [1] to [4], followed by
 *                      closure char (*) matches zero or more matches of
 *                      that form.
 *
 *      [6]     +       same as [5], except it matches one or more.
 *
 *      [7]             a regular expression in the form [1] to [10], enclosed
 *                      as \(form\) matches what form matches. The enclosure
 *                      creates a set of tags, used for [8] and for
 *                      pattern substution. The tagged forms are numbered
 *			starting from 1.
 *
 *      [8]             a \ followed by a digit 1 to 9 matches whatever a
 *                      previously tagged regular expression ([7]) matched.
 *
 *	[9]	\<	a regular expression starting with a \< construct
 *		\>	and/or ending with a \> construct, restricts the
 *			pattern matching to the beginning of a word, and/or
 *			the end of a word. A word is defined to be a character
 *			string beginning and/or ending with the characters
 *			A-Z a-z 0-9 and _. It must also be preceded and/or
 *			followed by any character outside those mentioned.
 *
 *      [10]            a composite regular expression xy where x and y
 *                      are in the form [1] to [10] matches the longest
 *                      match of x followed by a match for y.
 *
 *      [11]	^	a regular expression starting with a ^ character
 *		$	and/or ending with a $ character, restricts the
 *                      pattern matching to the beginning of the line,
 *                      or the end of line. [anchors] Elsewhere in the
 *			pattern, ^ and $ are treated as ordinary characters.

 *
 * Notes:
 *
 *	This implementation uses a bit-set representation for character
 *	classes for speed and compactness. Each character is represented 
 *	by one bit in a 128-bit block. Thus, CCL always takes a 
 *	constant 16 bytes in the internal nfa, and re_exec does a single
 *	bit comparison to locate the character in the set.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 *	pattern:	foo*.*
 *	compile:	CHR f CHR o CLO CHR o END CLO ANY END END
 *	matches:	fo foo fooo foobar fobar foxx ...
 *
 *	pattern:	fo[ob]a[rz]	
 *	compile:	CHR f CHR o CCL bitset CHR a CCL bitset END
 *	matches:	fobar fooar fobaz fooaz
 *
 *	pattern:	foo\\+
 *	compile:	CHR f CHR o CHR o CHR \ CLO CHR \ END END
 *	matches:	foo\ foo\\ foo\\\  ...
 *
 *	pattern:	\(foo\)[1-3]\1	(same as foo[1-3]foo)
 *	compile:	BOT 1 CHR f CHR o CHR o EOT 1 CCL bitset REF 1 END
 *	matches:	foo1foo foo2foo foo3foo
 *
 *	pattern:	\(fo.*\)-\1
 *	compile:	BOT 1 CHR f CHR o CLO ANY END EOT 1 CHR - REF 1 END
 *	matches:	foo-foo fo-fo fob-fob foobar-foobar ...
